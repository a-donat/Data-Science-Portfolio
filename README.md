See below for a description of the following five projects:

	1. AB Test Mobile App User Retention
	2. Classification: Breast Cancer Detection
	3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Interactive Explanation
	4. Predicting Customer Spending from Website, Mobile App, and In-Store Activity
	5. Predicting Sales from Advertising Budget

## AB Test Mobile App User Retention

This project highlights the following:

	1. My ability to conduct an AB Test when the ideal data is not available.
	2. My ability to check the integrity of the design of an AB Test.

Libraries Used: numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib

Analyses/Techniques: Bootstrapping, Chi-squared Test, T-Test

	
## Classification: Breast Cancer Detection
This project highlights the following:

      1. My mastery of the major classification methods in machine learning.
      2. My ability to train classification models in a context where minimizing
      false negatives (maximizing recall) is more important than overall accuracy.
      3. My ability to finetune the hyperparameters of these analyses. 
      4. My ability to construct pipelines that connect data processing with data analysis.
      5. My understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of each method, 
      and how to combine methodologies accordingly.
      6. My superior data visualization skills.

Libraries Used: numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn

Models/Techniques: Principal Component Analysis, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes,
K Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine


## Interactive Explanation of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Libraries Used: numpy, pandas, sklearn, ipywidgets, matplotlib, seaborn

Topics Covered: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Covariance, 
Linear Algebra (Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues), Dimensionality Reduction


## Predicting Customer Spending from Website, Mobile App, and In-Store Activity

This project highlights the following:

      1. My mastery of the major prediction and regression methods in machine learning.
      2. My ability to use finetune the hyperparameters of these analyses. 
      3. My understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of each method.
      4. My ability to extract meaningful information from seemingly arbitrary data.
      5. My superior data visualization skills.
      
Libraries Used: numpy, pandas, regex, scipy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn

Models: Linear Regression, RANSAC Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, 
ADABoost Regression
