# An Interactive Explanation of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Note: 

The widgets do not display while viewing the notebook online. In order to interact with 
the widgets, please download and run the notebook. I have added photos and
video for some of the widgets, which can be found in the 'Widget Photos and Video'
folder.

Libraries Used: numpy, pandas, sklearn, ipywidgets, matplotlib, seaborn

Outline : 

      1. Set-Up
      2. Dataset
      3. Description of the Principal Component Analysis
      4. PCA Steps
            A. Standardize the data
            B. Construct the covariance matrix
                  a. What is covariance?
                  b. Visualizing Covariance
            C. Obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix
                  a. What are eigenvalues and eigenvectors?
                  b. Visualizing Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues
            D. Create matrix of ranked eigenvectors
            E. Multiply Data by Eigenvector Matrix
                  a. How does multiplication by the Eigenvector Matrix transform the data?
            F. Reduce Dimensionality of PCA Transformed Dataset
      5. PCA in SK-Learn
      6. Disadvantages and Limits of PCA
